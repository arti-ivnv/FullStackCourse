React component names must be capitalized

The code is written into files ending with .js that 
are run by issuing the command node name_of_file.js

It is also possible to write JavaScript code into the Node.js 
console, which is opened by typing node in the command-line


JS syntax: 

const does not actually define a variable but a constant 
for which the value can no longer be changed. 
On the other hand, let defines a normal variable.

CODE: 
============
const x = 1
let y = 5
============

It is also possible to define variables
in JavaScript using the keyword var.

In specific situations, var works in a 
different way compared to variable definitions in most languages.

var is gonna keep the value through all the program (like vars in other PL)
Like after executing a loop value will still be remained. Unlikely, let keyword
won't let us to use a variable that is "out of braces" (reference error)

array can be modified even though it is defined as a const.
Because the array is an object, the variable always points 
to the same object. However, the content of the array changes as new items are added to it.

One characteristic of the functional programming paradigm is the use of
immutable data structures. In React code, it is preferable to use the method concat,
which does not add the item to the array, but creates a new array in which the content
of the old array and the new item are both included.

CODE:
=========================================
const t = [1, -1, 3]

const t2 = t.concat(5)

console.log(t)  // [1, -1, 3] is printed
console.log(t2) // [1, -1, 3, 5] is printed
=========================================
