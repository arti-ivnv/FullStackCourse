The server and the web browser communicate with each other using the HTTP protocol. 
The Network tab shows how the browser and the server communicate.

The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. 
Requests using GET should only be used to request data (they shouldn't include data).

Status codes:
1xx informational response – the request was received, continuing process
2xx successful – the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
3xx redirection – further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
4xx client error – the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
5xx server error – the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request
